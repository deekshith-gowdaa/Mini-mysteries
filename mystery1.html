  <h1>The Vanishing Watch</h1>
  <p>Detective Mira was called to a mansion where a priceless pocket watch had disappeared. 
  Three people were in the study when it vanished — the butler polishing silver, the maid dusting shelves, 
  and the owner reading near the window. The maid claimed she saw the butler take the watch, 
  but he said he never left the table. The owner insisted no one moved near him.  
  Yet Mira solved it in seconds. How?</p>

  <button onclick="document.querySelector('.answer').style.display='block'">Reveal Answer 🔍</button>

  <div class="answer">
    <p>The watch was never stolen — it was still on the owner's chain, hidden by his book cover. 
    The maid was lying to cover the broken vase she knocked over!</p>
